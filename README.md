# HilbertSpaces.jl

(https://img.shields.io/badge/Julia-1.0.2v-a270ba.svg)[]

**HilbertSpaces.jl** is a draft for a Julia library for exact diagonalization and DMRG methods.
It's an early stage, work in progress library.

The aim of this library is to let me grasp the basics of quantum system simulations while learning Julia.
As a byproduct, I hope to provide an easy to use interface to explore the phenomenology of low dimensional quantum systems, with particular attention to spin chains.
